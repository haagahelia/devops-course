:::info[TASK: Containerize an application]
Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/ to containerize a simple web application step by step. You will learn how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a container from that image. The source code for the application does not require modifications, and it can be found at https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app/.

During the task, you will need to apply knowledge from the [Getting started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/) section of Docker documentation.
