title: Monitoring in DevOps
---
Monitoring is a critical part of DevOps practices. It ensures the health, performance, and reliability of applications, infrastructure, and services.

Why monitoring is critical?
- Monitoring helps identify potential issues before they impact end-users. This allows teams to take corrective actions proactively.
- Continuous monitoring ensures that systems remain operational and meet service-level agreements.
- By analyzing metrics, teams can identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.
- Real-time alerts enable quicker responses to incidents, reducing downtime and minimizing impact.

There are different types of monitorig used in DevOps:

**Infrastructure Monitoring** tracks the health and performance of servers, networks, storage, and other infrastructure components.

**Application Performance Monitoring** focuses on application-level metrics like response time, error rates, and throughput.

**Log Monitoring** collects and analyzes logs to identify errors, security issues, or unusual behavior.

**Network Monitoring** monitors network traffic, latency, and connectivity issues.

**Security Monitoring** detects vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and potential threats.
