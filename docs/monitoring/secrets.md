When working with CI/CD pipelines, it's common to need credentials or API keysâ€”for example, to deploy to a cloud provider or access third-party services. Storing these securely is critical. GitHub Secrets provides a secure way to store and manage sensitive data like when using GiHub actions.

### Github Secrets

GitHub supports storing secrets at different levels:
- Repository-level secrets: Specific to a single repository.
- Environment-level secrets: Used within specific environments (e.g., production, staging).
- Organization-level secrets: Shared across multiple repositories.

In this course we are using repository-level secrets. 

How to Add a Secret:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Name your secret (e.g., API_KEY) and type the secret value.

### Using Secrets in Workflows

You can use secrets in your workflow .yml file with the `secrets` context.

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run the app
        //highlight-start
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        //highlight-end
        run: |
          echo "Running the app..."
          node app.js
```

Never hard-code secrets in your code or workflow files. You should also limit secret scope. Use environment or repo-level secrets as needed. 

Secrets are not injected into your application directly by GitHub. Instead, they are exposed to the runtime environment, and your application accesses them using environment variables.

In your application code, you access it using your language's environment variable access method. For example,

```js title="Node.js"
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

```python title="Python"
import os
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```
