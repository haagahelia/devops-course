DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security into every stage of the software development lifecycle, combining development (Dev), security (Sec), and operations (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to identify and address security issues early and continuously.

**Practical examples of DevSecOps:**

**Automated Security Testing:** Integrating tools like CodeQL or SonarQube into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities.

**Container Security:** Using tools such as Trivy or Aqua Security to scan container images for known vulnerabilities before deployment.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning:** Employing tools like Checkov or Terraform Compliance to ensure infrastructure code follows security best practices.

**Secrets Management:** Implementing solutions like HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault to securely manage sensitive information such as API keys and passwords.
