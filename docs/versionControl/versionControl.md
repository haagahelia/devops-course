Since the [creation of Git in 2005](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git), it has become the de facto standard for version control in software development. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

To this point you may have learned about the basic commands and workflows of Git, such as `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`. On this course, we will focus on more advanced topics in situations, where you are working with a team of developers on a project.

If you do not feel comfortable with the basic commands of Git, we recommend that you utilize resources such as [the Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [Git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) to fill in the gaps. You can also find many tutorials and courses online that cover the basics of Git.

We will use GitHub as our version control system, but the concepts are applicable to other systems as well.
