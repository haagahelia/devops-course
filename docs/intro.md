# Course Intro

Welcome to the DevOps course!

In this course, you will get a basic understanding of DevOps principles, tools, and practices. We will explore how to streamline software development and delivery processes, enabling faster and more reliable deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this course, you will need a GitHub account and Docker installed on your computer. We recommend that you have a separate GitHub account for your studies, in case you are using your existing account for professional work.

If you have difficulties installing Docker locally on your system, you can use online development environments such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or remote virtual machines to run Docker. These options can be discussed in more detail at the beginning of the course.

It is also recommended that you have the following knowledge:

- **Basic understanding of Git version control system.**

  If you are new to Git, check out [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/doc) or [GitHub's Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

- **Basic understanding of GitHub.**

  Learn the basics of GitHub with [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

- **Familiarity with command-line tools and basic shell commands.**

  If you are unfamiliar with the command line, you can start with [Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line).

- **Knowledge of programming fundamentals (e.g., writing and understanding scripts).**


- **Knowledge of software development lifecycle concepts.**

  If this is new to you, consider reading [SDLC Overview](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/).

These resources can help you if you are unfamiliar with any of the topics.
